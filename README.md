Hello!

This is a microproject--fairly basic landing page with a backdrop image and some images in the form of a gallery. Through this, I hope to learn more about creating landing pages more efficiently...

Note: I'm having a hard time with extra blank space being produced at the bottom of the website...I plan to fix this with more time. Furthermore the text in the center is not - responsive friendly.
